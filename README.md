# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Project Overview
Cybersecurity threats are increasing rapidly, and traditional defenses (like firewalls and signature-based tools) are not enough to stop modern attacks.  
This project aims to build a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that can identify malicious network traffic using machine learning.  

The goal is to help reduce false alarms, improve detection accuracy, and make networks more secure against evolving threats.

## Objectives
- Clearly define the problem of detecting malicious network traffic.  
- Explain why intrusion detection is important in today’s digital world.  
- Design and implement a machine learning–based system to classify network traffic.  
- Evaluate the system using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Document the process in both a notebook and this repository.  

## Milestone 1 Deliverables
